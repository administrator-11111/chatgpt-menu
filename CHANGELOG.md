#### v0.0.5
> 03 Jul 2025 03:02 PM

- Fixed the background path again.

#### v0.0.4
> 03 Jul 2025 02:06 PM

- Updated the path on the css file of the background so now it has a relative path and not an absoluta path for github pages.

#### v0.0.3
> 03 Jul 2025 01:25 PM

- Updated the paths of the css and javascript files so they are relative paths and not absolute paths for github pages.

#### v0.0.2

> 03 Jul 2025 02:38 AM

- Optimized the background with WebP and improved performance by downloading the image and hosting it on the server itself.
- Separated the styles into the corresponding CSS file.
- Applied the background on all devices and fixed its position, hopefully for all of them.
- Moved the `<h1>` into the header and separated "Tótem de Pedido" and "Casino UCM", placing the last one in an `<h2>` for better design.
- Added a blur filter/effect to the header and cart to enhance visual appeal.
- Made the "Confirmar pedido" button larger so it works better on mobile devices (for the possible "Tótem").
- Arranged the payment buttons inside a flexbox container with `flex-direction: column` to improve the layout.
- Made the "Cancelar" button red to make it more intuitive.
- In the receipt, adjusted the `receipt-container` so it has not only top margin but also bottom margin, creating a more symmetrical and visually pleasing layout (previously, the "Volver al inicio" button was too close to the container, which didn’t look good).
- Slightly adjusted the colors for better contrast.
- Changed the color of "Casino UCM" in the header to enhance its appearance and show that it is a subtitle.
